### Prosocial
Prosocial behavior or motivation refers to actions and attitudes that are driven by a concern for the well-being and interests of others. Individuals with a prosocial orientation are typically cooperative, empathetic, and altruistic. They are inclined to help, share, and support others, often putting the collective good or the welfare of others above their personal interests.

### Proself
Proself behavior or motivation, on the other hand, is characterized by a self-centered or self-interested focus. People with a proself orientation prioritize their individual interests and well-being over those of others. They may be competitive and inclined to pursue personal gains, even if it comes at the expense of others or the collective

- Teams working on a common problem may have members with different goals and objectives related to that issue. These competing interests can complicate decision-making.

- The positive effects of high cognitive motivation on team decision-making are contingent on team members having a prosocial rather than proself motivation. In other words, they need to be motivated to work **together** for collective success rather than prioritizing **personal** or constituency interests.

- Many decision-making situations can be seen as a mix of cooperation to achieve shared goals and competition to advance individual interests

- The concept of [[Social Motivation]] plays a role in how team members behave when interests align or diverge. When interests align, team members tend to exhibit prosocial behaviors, seeking consensus and fairness. In contrast, when interests diverge, team members may adopt a proself orientation, prioritizing their own goals over collective success. 

- Proself behaviors can have several negative impacts on the team decision process and outcome. They can limit the potential for mutual gains, prevent the development of creative solutions, and create "winners" and "losers" within the team, leading to lower commitment to implementing the team decision.

- When team members have differing interests, and they are highly motivated to prioritize their individual goals over team goals (proself behaviors), it can lead to biases in information presentation and an exaggeration of their own ideas, while ignoring opposing evidence

- Effective team decision-making is more likely when team members have high [[Cognitive motivation]] and a prosocial orientation. However, this is contingent on having enough time to make the decision and representing all key stakeholders in the situation
