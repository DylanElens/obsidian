Cognitive motivation ('Epistemic motivation') refers to the "willingness to expend effort to achieve a thorough, rich and accurate understanding of the world, including the group task or decision at hand"

it affects the depth of information processing.


Teams with high levels of cognitive motivation are better at surfacing diverse information and interests within the team, leading to a higher likelihood of experiencing conflict. This can be constructive when the conflict remains at a "cognitive" level.
