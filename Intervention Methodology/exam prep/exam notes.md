An aspect of **messy problems** is the interconnectedness between different aspects of the sistuation, its systemicity, that makes messy problems particularly challenging to manage. There is also a high level of uncertianty

Involving key stakeholder is a challenge for several reasons
1. Different stakeholders may have different perspectives that lead to partial and biased interpretations of, and responses to, the situation
2. Stakeholders may have different goals and interests which can result in conflict.
3. The parties involved may have different power sources to deal with the situation.


## How can we maximize the change of succesfully tackling **messy** situations?
### individuals
**individuals** faced with the tasks of tackling a messy situation must define the situation in such a way that  can be identified and justified. Identifying a situation involves articulating what makes the situation as it is and how it involves the achievement of goals.
Individuals generally do not consider all information that is relevant to a problem situation.

Individuals find it difficult to articulate which information should be taken into account. they do not search for the optimal solutions  instead are satisfied with 'good enough' results
Individuals are **bounded rational** and only search for **satisfying** solutions.

In order to make sense of complex situations inddiviuals use a number of mental strategies.
1. Use a [[Intervention Methodology/exam prep/frame|frame]] to understand what is going on
2. Use the [[Intervention Methodology/exam prep/Availibility bais|Availibilty bais]]
3. Use the [[Intervention Methodology/exam prep/Sunk-Cost bais|Sunk-cost bais]]
4. Use the [[Intervention Methodology/exam prep/Confirmation bais|Confirmation bias]]
5. Use the [[Intervention Methodology/exam prep/Anchoring bias|Anchoring bias]]
6. Use the [[Intervention Methodology/exam prep/Representative bias|Representative bias]]

These are also called **heuristics**

Teams make make all biases worse execpt
Availibilty and anchoring

### Teams
A team is three or more individuals who are brought together to make a decision or provide a recommendation about a situation that needs to be addressed.
Unfortunately, the empirical evidence suggests that individual errors(baises) are often amplified at the team level.
Teams do not always achieve their goals due to 'loses' in the decision making process

#### MIP-G theory
The MIP-G theory(Motivated information processing in Groups) sheds light on the role of different motivations in teams, and extends the notion of teams from information processors to teams a motivated information processors.

Broadly the theory posits that both [[Intervention Methodology/exam prep/Cognitive motivation|Cognitive Motivation]] and [[Intervention Methodology/exam prep/Social Motivation|Social Motivation]] drives the sharing and integration of information within teams

In MIP-G desribes the friction between [[Proself vs Prosocial]].

Cognitive conflict, which involves disagreements over ideas and information, can be beneficial for team decision-making, as it encourages a critical examination of assumptions and leads to better insights. However, if cognitive conflict turns into affective conflict, characterized by personal emotions and defensiveness, it can hinder effective teamwork.

### complex situations 
In a complex situation there are a number of interacting problems that involve diverse stakeholders, whose unanticipated responses make it difficult to choose where to focus decision making efforts. Even if a clear focus is set, attempts to improve the situation may produce unintended results due to uncertainty around developments in the situation, or the actions and reactions of other parties.

The quality of team decision-making is influenced by the balance between cognitive and social motivation. Teams with high cognitive motivation and a prosocial orientation tend to make better decisions by critically evaluating information. Teams with low cognitive motivation and prosocial orientation may avoid conflict but may also compromise too easily.


## interventions

Interventions are procedure to improve processes of any kind.
Interventions are comprised of *designed facilitated activities carried out in order to help a team achieve its goals.*

### Divergent and Convergent Thinking:
Effective team decision-making involves both divergent and convergent thinking processes. 

**Divergent thinking** involves generating ideas and exploring different perspectives, objectives, and alternatives. A lack of divergence can lead to a premature consensus and sub-optimal decisions

**Convergent thinking** involves organizing and prioritizing ideas and information to identify decision options. A lack of convergence may result in an impasse

#### debaising
2 modes of thinking:
- **System 1 thinking:**
  - This is intuitve and automatic.
  - heavily biased
  - useful for routine decisions
  - based on passed experience
- **System 2 thinking:**
  - Delibarite and analytical
  - Effortful thinking
  - reducing bias
  - Logical and rational

System 1 is the fast and automatic mode of think thus is prone to bias, system 2 is slow and deliberate

3 approaches to debaising:
1. **Motivational approach**:
   This approach relies on increasing motivation for individuals to engage in System 2 thinking (more deliberate and rational) rather than System 1 thinking (intuitive and biased).
2. **Cognitive Approach**:
   Cognitive strategies aim to improve individuals' thinking processes by providing instructions or formal training in disciplines such as statistics, economics, and logical reasoning.
3. **Technological Approach**: This approach involves external support to expand decision-making strategies. Presenting information as frequencies rather than probabilities, using graphical representations, and employing various knowledge elicitation techniques have been successful in reducing biases.


### Brainstorming
During a brainstorming session, team members are encouraged to freely express any ideas that come to mind, without immediate judgment or criticism. The goal is to create an environment where unusual or unconventional ideas are welcomed. This is important because in a typical meeting, innovative ideas may seem strange, and people might hesitate to share them or face criticism from others.

However, brainstorming does have some limitations, particularly related to the content of the ideas generated and potential process losses in the team. For example, brainstorming often results in long lists of ideas that are not well-structured or related, making it challenging to understand the relationships between different elements of the decision situation. unhelpful behaviors like "free-riding" (waiting for others to complete the task) or "production blocking" (waiting for their turn to speak, which hampers their ability to think of new ideas).

NGT hopes to solve these issues
### Nominal group theory

Here's how NGT works:

1. **Silent Idea Generation:** Participants are provided with a specific question or problem to address. Each person silently generates their ideas or solutions independently, usually by writing them down on index cards or sticky notes. This initial step encourages divergent thinking, similar to brainstorming.

2. **Round-Robin Sharing:** In a structured and organized manner, each participant takes turns sharing one of their ideas with the group. As each idea is presented, it is usually recorded on a shared board or flip chart for everyone to see. Unlike traditional brainstorming, there is no discussion or evaluation of the ideas at this stage.

3. **Clarification and Discussion:** After all participants have presented their ideas, the group engages in a structured discussion or clarification phase. This allows participants to seek clarification on any of the ideas presented, combining similar ideas, and identifying any redundancies or overlaps.

4. **Voting or Ranking:** Each participant is given a set number of votes (e.g., stickers or points) to allocate to the ideas they consider most important or valuable. This step prioritizes the ideas and helps identify the most favored or promising ones.
	
Brainstorming and similar methods often generate a multitude of unstructured ideas, which can seem chaotic but are essential for avoiding potential decision-making errors. The process moves from divergence (creative idea generation) to convergence (organizing and prioritizing).

Formal convergence methods include taxonomies, which use strict rules to categorize concepts into mutually exclusive categories, and typologies, which represent unique combinations of characteristics. A more informal approach to categorization is clustering, which groups similar ideas in a two-dimensional space.

To present the results of a brainstorming session, visualizing ideas in a two-dimensional space is an attractive alternative to a long list of ideas. After the convergence phase, decision-making groups often want to prioritize ideas based on criteria like importance, feasibility, urgency, or effort.


## **Group Model Building (GMB)**:

**GMB** is a method used to examine the performance of a system by creating visual models of that system. These models are constructed collaboratively with relevant stakeholders and serve as tools for understanding the system's past behavior. **GMB** helps separate the causes of **issues** from their **symptoms**, which is crucial for informed decision-making. These models also serve as a visual memory of team discussions and can be further developed for quantitative analysis using computer-based simulations.
##### Some important steps for group model building

1. **identify problem variable and reference mode of behaviour** 
   At the beginning of a modelling project, this issue is no more than a label for a problem that the client group is interested in. The work on structuring the problem, so finding symptoms, causes and solutions that all somehow interact to form the problem, starts after that.
   
2. **identify variables using Nominal Group Technique**  
   
3. **identify causal relations** 
	The second phase is the heart of group model building and asks participants to relate variables to each other. When drawing relations with a group, the rule that applies to all **convergent** activities also applies here: changes on the board need to be checked and agreed upon by all participants in the room. Once people agree to a proposed arrow, it is added to the model. In this way the model structure grows as new variables and relationships are added. The model purpose and system boundary operate as a limit to the addition of new variables. An element should be left out of the model if model purpose or behaviour are not affected by its inclusion. After working on causes, it is useful to switch to effects of the problem variable
   
4. check feedback loops 
5. check validity 
6. identify control and target variables


## Participatory Scenario Development

PSD Scenario planning is a family of approaches that aims to enhance understanding of a current situation by exploring possible alternative futures relevant to current decision-making. Participatory scenario development starts by eliciting ideas and data about the future from team members. These inputs are then integrated into narratives describing different possible futures, allowing team members to place themselves in these scenarios to gain insight into present actions.

5. **Group Causal Mapping**: This approach is rooted in the "soft" operational research tradition. It aims to explore the complexity of issues within the entire decision space as perceived by the team. By closely examining the relationships between issues from the team members' perspective, implied goals and options emerge during discussions. The approach helps in prioritizing issues, goals, and actions by considering their means-ends relationships.

6. **Decision Conferencing (DC)**: DC is part of the Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) family of approaches. It focuses on evaluating options against multiple decision criteria. DC is associated with facilitated modeling and can be carried out using simple computer-based technology, such as spreadsheets. This approach structures the objectives, options, preferences, and trade-offs relevant to the decision situation.
