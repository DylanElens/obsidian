Theoretical knowledge, will focus on: what does the method mean, concepts, the steps, the risks, the way it is implemented, the importance of it compared with other method, errors and the mitigation while implementing them, tools and techniques that are used in its implementation, the effectiveness of the method, etc. Very theoretical but you have been hearing this throughout the course (lectures, group documents, intervention sessions, backup office).

# Brainstorming
#### what does it mean?

the aim of brainstorming is to note down all ideas that may be of interest when thinking about the decision situation at hand, in order to prevent missing anything that might be considered important

#### steps
Nominal group theory:
1. **Silent Idea Generation**

2. **Round-Robin Sharing:** In a structured and organized manner, each participant takes turns sharing one of their ideas with the group.

3. **Clarification and Discussion:** 

4. **Voting or Ranking:** Each participant is given a set number of votes (e.g., stickers or points) to allocate to the ideas they consider most important or valuable. 

#### The importance of it compared with other method
Maximizing divergency -> generating as much options to the problem as possible.
#### errors and the mitigation while implementing them
**Errors:**
1. Long list of unconnected ideas
2. Potential for free-riding and Production blocking (stop searching for novel ideas because of the need to attend to what others are saying)

**Mitigations:**
1. -
2. NGT(nominal group theory):
   This technique is used with groups comprised of individuals who do not interact, which contrasts to brainstorming in which group members do interact

#### tools and techniques that are used in its implementation
1. Technique of NGT
2. Index cards, etc

#### the effectiveness of the method
A list of unconnected ideas maximizing divergency
Very useful for the start of solving a problem.


# Group model Building
#### what does it mean?
In essence, group model building aims to elicit ideas from session participants, confront these with one another and finally integrate these in a shared view on the problem at hand.
#### steps
1. Identify problem variable and reference mode of behavoir
2. Identify variables using Nominal Group Technique
3. Identify causal relationships -> (Postive, negative)
4. Check for feedback loops (A -> B -> C -> A)
   2 types of feedback loops:
   1. Negative / balancing feedback loops -> loop with positive AND negative relationships
   2. Positive / Reinforcing relationships -> relations with only positive or Only negative connections
   **Only positive -> only negative**
5. Check validity -> make sure it makes sense
6. Identify and control target variables
   A target variable is a variable that is easiest to modify/control to adjust a feedback loop -> profit/client-satifisfaction

#### the importance of it compared with other method
**GMB** helps separate the causes of **issues** from their **symptoms**,
#### errors and the mitigation while implementing them
It's the perfect intervention method!

#### tools and techniques that are used in its implementation
1. NGT -> technique
2. Boards
3. pen
4. paper
5. etc

#### the effectiveness of the method
- GMB explains the behaviour of a system and gives a holistic view of the system -> feedback loops
- It also showes the relations behind the ideas(problem structuring and diagnosis) -> postive vs negative relations
- Supports the construction of a shared mental model of a system -> model the system




# Multiple Scenario Development
#### what does it mean?
With MSD a set of scenarios is developed which each describe, what a possible future looks like and how it came to be. 

#### steps
1. Formulate starting issue or question
2. Identify trends
3. Cluster trends
4. Score clusters based on uncertainty and impact
5. Determine driving forces, elements, policies and indicators
6. Translate scenario's and write texts
7. Determine impact on transactional environment
8. Determine robust options

A robust option is a course of action that generates beneficial results, regardless of major developments in the environment

#### the importance of it compared with other method

#### errors and the mitigation while implementing them
The absence of explicit theoretical roots has led to the application of scenario planning as something of a "club members only" philosophy

scenarios are based on ‘speculation’ rather than facts

##### mitigation
central concepts and phases in the scenario methodology are becoming more clear. There is some evidence that considering plausible, alternative futures supports the identification of robust options and helps to discuss and reflect on plans for the long term
#### tools and techniques that are used in its implementation

boards,
graphs
pens,
paper

#### the effectiveness of the method
multiple scenario construction is a popular approach for developing strategy for a possible future.

In the end we deliver a set of robust options
# Group Causal Mapping

#### what does it mean?
Group causal mapping covers divergence, convergence as well as prioritisation. The models constructed in the convergence phase start from issues. ‘Laddering up’ connects issues to higher level goals and shows why issues are important.

actions -> issues -> goals
#### steps
1. Ask an action-oriented question or prompt
   "what can we do about problem X within timeframe Y?"
2. note awnsers(issues) on board
3. Link issues -> We stop diverging and start converging
4. Split a large map into clusters 
5. for each issue cluster ladder up to goals and down to actions

#### the importance of it compared with other method

#### errors and the mitigation while implementing them

**error:**
A common trap is to leave concepts unconnected to the rest of the model
**mitigation:**
In this case the facilitator will ask the team to identify these ‘orphans’ and link them to other concepts

**Error:**
Another common trap relates to the direction of the link between two concepts, which can be mistaken by participants
**Mitigation**:
Participants are therefore asked to link the proposed means of **actions** to the desired end of some **goal**

#### tools and techniques that are used in its implementation
Decision explorer software
#### the effectiveness of the method
In the end we return a big cuasal mapping linkin
actions to issues and issues to goals. This is very usefull for figuring out causes for the problem

# Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis

#### what does it mean?
MCDA is a structured way of ranking options(alternatives) on the basis of certian criteria.

#### steps
1. Determine the options
2. Determine the criteria
3. Determine the wieghts of each criteria
4. Assign a value of each criteria for each options
5. calculate the final scores of each option and determine the ranking of each option

#### the importance of it compared with other method

When you want to choose between a set of predfined options it is very usefull to use MCDA

#### errors and the mitigation while implementing them
The scores of the criteria will not always be in linearly separable


#### tools and techniques that are used in its implementation
- table
- matrix
- excel/sheets

#### the effectiveness of the method
The methods eventually gives us a ranking of predefines options
What is usefull is that if we decide afterwards that a certain criteria is not as important as initially though we can always adjust the weights.
