Frames are structured ways of thinking that simplify and guide our understand of reality. Frames force us to view the world in a particular, and limited, perspective and they strongly influence our perceptions of what we see or expect to see.

Our frames are selective and affected by:
 - Expertise
 - experience
 - motivation
 - context

**Adopting a frame is usually not a conscious choice**

A narrow frame bias is caused by associative memory processes that lead people to start with a set of assumptions, and then collect evidence in a way that is consistent with the initial view.
