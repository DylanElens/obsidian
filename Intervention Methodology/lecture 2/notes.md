### MIP-G theory

- Motivations
- "information processors": Process and integrate + consensus
- Cognitvie motivation: effort
  - depth
  - conflict
- Social motives. Proself, Prosocial:
  - Extent: Bais tthe type, process
- Both: cognition clusure, personality factors
  - Extent of each: damaging or helpful

#### proself -> more selfish


2 types of conflicts
- prosocial
  - Beneficial
  - Shared and hidden
- Pro self
  - Dysfunctional
  - Affective: switch the focus of attention




Foster increased cognitive motication and prosocial behaviours enable conflict to surface and be managed effectively.
