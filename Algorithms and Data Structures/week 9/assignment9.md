Step-by-Step Matrices

**Step 1: First Item (Value 8, Size 3)**
- Can't fit in capacities 1 and 2, so copy values from above (0s).
- Fits in capacities 3, 4, and 5. The value is 8 in all these cases.

```
  0 1 2 3 4 5
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 0 8 8 8
```

**Step 2: Second Item (Value 3, Size 2)** 
- Can't fit in capacity 1 (copy 0).
- Fits in capacities 2 to 5. For capacity 2, the value is 3. For higher capacities, compare (value without this item, value with this item):
    - For capacity 3: max(8, 3) = 8.
    - For capacity 4: max(8, 3 + 0) = 8.
    - For capacity 5: max(8, 3 + 8) = 11.
```
  0 1 2 3 4 5
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 0 8 8 8
2 0 0 3 8 8 11

```

**Step 3: Third Item (Value 9, Size 4)**
- Can't fit in capacities 1, 2, and 3.
- Fits in capacities 4 and 5. Compare values:
    - For capacity 4: max(8, 9) = 9.
    - For capacity 5: max(11, 9) = 11.
```
  0 1 2 3 4 5
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 0 8 8 8
2 0 0 3 8 8 11
3 0 0 3 8 9 11
```

**Step 4: Fourth Item (Value 6, Size 1)**
- Fits in all capacities. Compare values:
   - For capacity 1: max(0, 6) = 6.
   - For capacity 2: max(3, 6) = 6.
   - For capacity 3: max(8, 6) = 8.
   - For capacity 4: max(9, 8 + 6) = 14.
   - For capacity 5: max(11, 9 + 6) = 15.

```

# 2

```js
MatrixChainMultiplication(dimensions):
    // dimensions is an array where the ith matrix has dimensions[i-1] x dimensions[i]
    numMatrices = length(dimensions) - 1
    Initialize matrixCosts[numMatrices + 1][numMatrices + 1] to all zeroes

    // matrixCosts[i][j] will hold the minimum cost for multiplying matrices i through j
    for chainLength = 2 to numMatrices inclusive:
        for i = 1 to numMatrices - chainLength + 1 inclusive:
            j = i + chainLength - 1
            matrixCosts[i][j] = maximum possible value

            for k = i to j - 1 inclusive:
                cost = matrixCosts[i][k] 
                + matrixCosts[k + 1][j] 
                + dimensions[i - 1] 
                * dimensions[k] 
                * dimensions[j]

                if cost < matrixCosts[i][j]:
                    matrixCosts[i][j] = cost

    return matrixCosts[1][numMatrices]

```


# 3
```javascript
function MaxCoins(c):
    n = number of rows (or columns) in c
    Initialize dp[n][n]

    dp[0][0] = c[0][0]
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        for j from 0 to n-1:
            if i > 0 and j > 0:
                dp[i][j] = c[i][j] + max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
            else if i > 0:
                dp[i][j] = c[i][j] + dp[i-1][j]
            else if j > 0:
                dp[i][j] = c[i][j] + dp[i][j-1]

    return dp[n-1][n-1]
```

**Correctness**
The correctness of this algorithm is based on the principle of optimality in dynamic programming. By solving smaller subproblems (finding the maximum coins up to each cell) and using these solutions to build up to the larger problem, the algorithm ensures that the optimal path is followed. The decision at each cell `(i, j)` is based on the best of the previous states (either from the top or left), guaranteeing the optimal collection of coins at each step.

**Time Complexity**
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where `n` is the dimension of the grid. This is because each cell of the `dp` table is filled exactly once, and the filling of each cell takes constant time. Since there are `n^2` cells, the overall time complexity is quadratic with respect to the size


# 4

```javascript
function CanBeSegmented(s, d):
    n = length of s
    Create a boolean array dp of size n+1

    // Initialize the DP table
    dp[0] = true  // Empty string can be segmented

    // Fill the DP table
    for i from 1 to n:
        dp[i] = false

        // Check if any substring ending at i can form valid words
        for j from 0 to i-1:
            if dp[j] and d(s[j+1...i]):
                dp[i] = true
                break  // No need to check further if one valid segmentation is found

    return dp[n]  // True if the whole string can be segmented into valid words

```

The recurrence relation for the dynamic programming approach is defined as follows:

`dp[i] = true` if there exists some `j` in the range `0 â‰¤ j < i` such that `dp[j] = true` and `d(s[j+1...i]) = true`. Otherwise, `dp[i] = false`.

**Time Complexity Analysis**
The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. For each `i` (ranging from 1 to `n`), the inner loop iterates `j` times (ranging from 0 to `i-1`), resulting in a total of about 1/2 * n * (n-1) iterations. Each iteration involves a constant-time check (`dp[j]` and `d(s[j+1...i])`), assuming that the dictionary lookup `d(w)` takes constant time.
