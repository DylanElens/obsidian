Let G = (Vertices, edges) is an n-node undirected graph

Let us assume that G is a complete graph.
This means if there is no edge between two nodes, we can add it with an infinite cost.

<!-- Let Vertice 1 untill Vertice p be a partition of Vertices into p subsets called clusters -->

The set of Vertices is divided into p non-overlapping subsets V1...Vp known as clusters.
This means that V1 untill V2 are combines they form the orginal set.
