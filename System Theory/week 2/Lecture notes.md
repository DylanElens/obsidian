Things organisations do:
1. Set goals
2. operational regulation(OR)
3. Primary Processes(PP)
4. Design
   - Human Resources
   - Technology
   - Structure
   Together these three are called the **infrastructure**

Goals, Infrastructure and Regulation actions are not 100% certain to work

Regulating systems means showing desired behavior.

| time  | Color hair | Color eyes |
| ----- | ---------- | ---------- |
| $m_1$ | green      | blue       | 

the tuple (green, blue) is called state $m_1$

behavior is the sequence of states.


The norm value is the value that you want to be the desired behavior
the Desired behavior is determined by the **essential variables**

**essential variables** express the overarching goal of the system

#### desired behavior 
the essential behaviors have the essential variables be withing the norm values


# disturbance = bad
# Regulatory actions = good




| Regulatory table | Reg 1 | Reg 2              | Reg 3 |
| ---------------- | ----- | ------------------ | ----- |
| Dist 1           |       |                    |       |
| Dist 2           |       | Essential variable |       |
| Dist 3           |       |                    |       |






### types of regulation
1.  Regulation by Control
2.  Operational Regulation
3.  Regulation by Design



### Operation Regulation
Regulation given goals and given infrastuctere

some assumptions:
1. Essentail variables and norm values are given
2. Disturbances are also given
3. Regalotory actions are given
4. Infra is fixed

things we need for a proper infrastructure
1. transformations processos work well
2. is as invulunrable to disturbances as possible
3. Enough Regulatory actions for all possible disturbances



### types of operational regulation
1. Effective, efficient
2. Passive vs active
	- passive means there is no active seleection of RA's
	- this means that RA is carried out automatically
	- there is active selection.
	- there are error controlled and cuase controlled regulations
	- the biggest difference is the RA's are executed **after** the Disturbance happens as called error controlled. It is the other way around for cause controlled. Cause controlled is preventative measure.
