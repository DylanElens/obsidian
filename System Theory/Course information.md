# Content of the course

The main theme of the (course) Systems Theory is “the regulation of systems”, or somewhat more specific: the question how systems can deal with complexity so that they can secure their viability. As Ashby, one of the founding fathers of systems theory put it: Systems theory “…offers the hope of providing effective methods for study and control of systems that are intrinsically extremely complex”.

Applied to organizations, systems theory offers conceptual instruments (1) to describe organizations, and (2) to design them. In this course we will introduce basic concepts from systems theory and show how these concepts can be used to describe organizations (as “social systems that need to experiment to secure their survival”) and design them (in particular their so-called ‘infrastructure’).

In order to do that, we will treat the following subjects:

  

**Basic concepts from systems theory**
An introduction into Classic Systems Theory (also: cybernetics). Here, the work of W.R. Ashby is central. Based on his work concepts like ‘system’, ‘complexity’, ‘systemic behaviour’, ‘essential variables’, ‘disturbances’, and ‘regulation’ are treated.

**Literature**:

“The experimental arche: Ashby’s cybernetics” (Chapter 2 from Achterbergh, J. & Vriens, D., 2010, Organizations: social systems conducting experiments,

Heidelberg: Springer 2nd ed.)

A reflection on cybernetics based on the work of Von Foerster. Here, we will go into some problems in Ashby’s way of describing the regulation of systems.

**Literature**:

“The experimental arche continued: Von Foerster on Observing systems” (Chapter 3 from Achterbergh, J. & Vriens, D., 2010, Organizations: social systems conducting experiments, Heidelberg: Springer 2nd ed.)

**Understanding organizations as systems**
In this course, we will **describe** organizations as a specific type of systems: as

‘social systems conducting experiments’. We will derive this description from the theory put forward by Ashby and Luhmann. That is, we will

Use Ashby’s cybernetics to understand what it means that organizations need to experiment. Literature: Chapter 1 and 2 from Achterbergh, J. & Vriens, D., 2010, Organizations: social systems conducting experiments, Heidelberg: Springer 2nd ed.).

Describe organizations as **social systems** based on the theory put forward by Luhmann. Literature: Chapter 4: “The second Arche, Organizations as social systems: Luhmann.” From Achterbergh, J. & Vriens, D., 2010, Organizations: social systems conducting experiments, Heidelberg: Springer 2nd Ed.)

**Systems Theory as a conceptual background for designing organizations**

In this course we will discuss that systems theory offers two kinds of principles for designing organizations (i.c. their infrastructures). The first set of principles describes the **functions** that every organization (i.c. its infrastructure) should be able to realize. These principles are called ‘functional design principles’. The second set of principles describe how specific parts of the organization (i.c. its infrastructure) should be designed. These principles are called ‘specific design principles’. We will describe these specific design principles to discuss the design of organizational structures and to discuss dealing with human resources in organizations. To discuss how organizations (i.c. their infrastructures) can be designed we will go into:

**Functional design principles** (describing **what** every organization should be able to do to remain viable) are discussed based on the theory of Ashby (and the general model of organizations that is derived from it) and on the theory by Beer. (Chapter 2 and 6 from Achterbergh, J. & Vriens, D., 2010, Organizations: social systems conducting experiments Heidelberg: Springer 2nd Ed.);
    
Designing organizational structures based on systems theory. Here we refer to de Sitter’s ‘socio technical organization design’. Literature: “Specific design principles: De Sitter’s organizational structures” (chapter 7 from Achterbergh, J. & Vriens, D., 2010, Organizations: social systems conducting experiments Heidelberg: Springer 2nd Ed.)

A reflection on dealing with human resources from a systems theoretic perspective. This will be done based on the theory put forward by Foucault. Literature: “Poor survival: disciplining organizational behavior” (Hoofdstuk 9 uit Achterbergh, J. & Vriens, D., 2010, Organizations: social systems conducting experiments Heidelberg: Springer 2nd Ed.)

**2. Lectures and seminars**

There are three types of meetings: plenary lectures (on Monday’s; here theory is discussed), small group meetings (Wednesday’s) and plenary seminars (Friday’s). In the latter two meetings we discuss assignments.

**Plenary lectures.**

In total, there are 7 plenary lectures (see course schedule, point 5). The first lecture will be held on September 4th

- After every lecture a summary will be put on Brightspace.

**Small seminar meetings (Wednesday)**

In weeks 38 – 42 mandatory group meetings are planned on Wednesday. You are supposed to make two types of assignments (so-called ‘case’ and ‘text’ assignments – see below) in a group of three students. During the Wednesday meetings the text assignments will be discussed. The seminar meetings will be attended by approximately 10 groups of three students. **You need to register as a group of three students at the start of the course**. Details wrt the registration for the seminar meetings will become available via Brightspace. **The first seminar meeting will be held on Wednesday 20** **September.**

**Plenary seminars (Friday)**

In weeks 38-42 plenary seminars will be held. Some of the assignments you are supposed to make (the case assignments) will be graded. These need to be handed in on Friday before 13:00 via Brightspace. At the Friday meetings we will discuss these assignments and you can also ask questions about them. **Please note: in week 36 and 37 there are no lectures on Friday.**

Please note that you are supposed to make assignments in a group of three students and that you prepare the Wednesday meetings with this group. You need to form a group of three students and register at the start of the course. Information about registration will be provided on Brightspace and during the first lecture.

  

With respect to the assignments the following is important.

1. After every plenary lecture (on Monday) starting in week 37, assignments will be put on Brightspace concerning the content of that week’s lecture.

2. This assignment consists of two parts: ‘text assignments’ and ‘case assignments’. The goal of making the text assignments is to elucidate and familiarize students with the theory. The goal of the case assignments is to apply the theory to deal with (organizational) issues.

3. You need to prepare and make both type of assignments with your group of 3 students.

4. The text assignments are discussed during the Wednesday meetings (in the week after they were made available – see schedule to find out which assignment is discussed in which meeting).

5. Preparing the text assignments means: (1) study the related chapter and lecture notes (2) discuss the assignments in your group and (3) formulate an answer to the questions.

6. At the start of the Wednesday meeting you need to have handed in your text assignment (see schedule to find out which assignment should be handed in at which meeting).

7. You also need to make the case assignments and hand them in via Brightspace on Friday (the week after they became available) before 13:00. See schedule to find out which assignment is due when.

8. The case assignment will be discussed in the lectures on Friday.

9. The case assignments will be graded (sufficient or insufficient) and are part of the exam (see below).

10. All assignments will become available via Brightspace.
  

**3. Examination**

  

Students will pass the course if they:

1. Have received the grade ‘sufficient’ for all of the case assignments;

2. Have handed in all text assignments;

3. Have attended the seminars on Wednesday and participated actively during these meetings.

AND if they

4. Have passed the written exam (grade >= 5.5)

The grade for the written exam will also be the final grade of course (if all criteria above are met).

If you have an ‘insufficient’ for a case assignments, you need to make an appointment with your seminar supervisor for an extra assignment. This extra assignment needs to handed in before the re-sit.

You are only allowed to do this extra assignment if you have handed in all text assignments, attended all meetings and participated actively.

The written exam consists of multiple choice questions and open questions.

The written exam will cover:

1. All lectures / seminars;

2. Chapter 1, 2, 3 (i.e. only section 3.1 and 3.2), 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
