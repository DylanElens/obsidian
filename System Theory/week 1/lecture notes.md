### Regulating Systems

Making sure that a system shows desired behaviors despite disturbances


#### System
Concrete unity consists of elements and relations between those elements showing behavior


#### desired behavior
we care about the following chain
behavior -> activities and the effect of those activities -> variables and values


#### case: Plank sawing department

There are direct outputs and indirect output of a transformation process. These are Effects


Variables and values describe the effect
Example variables:
- Quantity: variables storing the number of planks sawed per week
- Quality: % of "good" planks
- Employee satisfaction: -> this is an indirect effect

The behavior is the sequence of values from your variables


#### concrete unity
2 types of elements, and 1 type of relation

elements:
- Human Resources
- Technology

Structure -> the way tasks are defined an related to each other.


#### desired behavior

Desired behavior -> behaviors are withing the norm values
norms can also be a range: $min < x < max$

undesired behavior -> a cause for this is disturbance.

***it is important to make a distinction for desired and undesired behavior***

Regulation is making sure that a system shows desired behavior despite having disturbances

In order to regulate you have to think of actions(define them) and perform them

## Recipe for regulation

To regulate we should follow some steps
1. Define System 
   - Concrete system
   - Abstract
2. Define Desired behavior
3. Determine Disturbances
4. Regulatory actions (define and carry them out)


#### Bathtub example

behaviour -> having a bath


Concrete unity
- Elements -> You, water, bathub (persons and things)
- Relation -> It's a task you have developed for having a bath

this is called the concrete system of having a bath

##### Desired behavior variables
- water level,
- water temperature -> norm values = min(36) max(38)



## complexity
This is with regards to variety.
Usually means the amount of items in a set:
{A, 1, 3} -> complexity = 3

A transformation product has effects
There also exists a set of disturbances
The higher the variety of the set of disturbances
There is also a set of regulatory actions. Here the complexity is a good thing

D = {$D_1, D_2, D_3$}
RA = {$RA_1, RA_2, RA_3$} 

You should have enough Regulatory actions to handle your disturbances
Enough complexity means that you have enough RA to handle all disturbances. An RA can deal with more than 1 disturbance


### other stuff


General System theory -> Organisations
- Understand organisations as a system -> Social system conducting experiments
- Design infastructure
	infrastructure = {Human Resources, Technology, Structure}
	 

an organisation is a Social system conducting experiments
- experimenting -> there is some non-trivial problem that needs to be solved. You come up with a solution that hopes to solve the problem. The solution is a hypothesis.
- Problem -> Solution -> implement -> monitor -> Problem
- survival -> you set goals in the hopes to survive



## 1. modal of organisations
- in every organisation does 4 basic acitivties
	1. primary processes that lead up to products and services
	2. Operational Regulation -> dealing with disturbances that infringe with primary processes
	3. Setting goals for the primary processes
	4. Design -> Human Resources and Technology and structure (this is called the infrastructure of an organisation)

## 2. Social system conducting experiments
## 3. Design infrastructure
