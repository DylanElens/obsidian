### Regulating Systems

Making sure that a system shows desired behaviors despite disturbances


#### System
Concrete unity consists of elements and relations between those elements showing behavior


#### desired behavior
we care about the following chain
behavior -> activities and the effect of those activities -> variables and values


#### case: Plank sawing department

There are direct outputs and indirect output of a transformation process. These are Effects


Variables and values describe the effect
Example variables:
- Quantity: variables storing the number of planks sawed per week
- Quality: % of "good" planks
- Employee satisfaction: -> this is an indirect effect

The behavior is the sequence of values from your variables


#### concrete unity
2 types of elements, and 1 type of relation

elements:
- Human Resources
- Technology

Structure -> the way tasks are defined an related to each other.


#### desired behavior

Desired behavior -> behaviors are withing the norm values
norms can also be a range: $min < x < max$

undesired behavior -> a cause for this is disturbance.

***make a distinction for desired and undesired behavior***

Regulation is making sure that a system shows desired behavior despite having disturbances

In order to regulate you have to think of actions(define them) and perform them
