### A
NP stands for non-deterministic Polynomial time. It is the set of problems whose solutions can be verified in polynomial time. But as far as we know 1 many of these problems take **exponential** time to solve.

NP-hard is the defining property of a class of problems that are at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP.

A problem is NP-Complete when it is a **decision problem** meaning that for any input to the problem the output is either a yes or a no. When the answer is yes it means it can be demonstrated through a short solution

### B.




# 2

### A
Best case: $O(n)$
Worst case: $O(n)$

### B
No. The reason is because we want to find a specific number in a list of unsorted arrays. Where the list sorten we could have done binary search which would have a complexity of $O(log( n))$.

### C
Best case: $O(n)$
Worst case: $O(n)$

### D
Best case: $O(n)$
Worst case: $O(n)$

Yes a binary search would be better


# 3

### A. 
This one is in $P$
### B.
Yes as it has a complexity of $O(V*V)$

### C.
No, as this has polynomail complexity

### D.
Yes as it has a complexity of $O(n^2)$

### E.
Yes as it has a complexity of $O(n \ log(n))$
