Research is the creation of new knowlegde, using an approproate process to the satisfaction of the users of the reaserch.

Thesis = a claim or proposition. 
argument a set of evidence that supports the thesis.
Users are satisified whne they are convinced that the new knowledge is valid and can be added to the existing body of research.
Users must acept the product (reseach findings) and they must also find the process to be appropriate.

Build an argument: 
- Logic: build a detailed and structured description of your reasoning process
- Draw on existing ork. Survery realted work, build on existing theory and results
- Carry out fieldwork: Collect, analzing, and interpret data and draw conclusions

Evidence-based computing:
- When people suggest how to decelop better systems, or how to do new things with computers they must provide evidence to support their proposals
- this evidence takes the form of empirical assessment and evaluation.

Empirical = originating in or based on observation or experience

# Research going wrong
- fruad
- invalid assumptions
- limited observation
	-  Survivorship bais
	- seletive windowing
	- Cherry picking; ignoring the conflicting evidence
	- Small samples
 - limited explanation
	 - Limted alternatice explanations
	- Confounding factors 
	- no baseline
	- No hypothesis
	- Spurious correlations



### Hawthorne effect
People modify their behavior because they are aware of being observed
Improvement in productivity slumped when they study ended

### Confounding factors in experiments
- formulating a proper scientific hypothesis  requires taking into considaration both what we know and what we don't know
- If a scientific hypothesis is properly formulated, it is falsifiable: it is possible to determine whether the hypothesis is true or not
- Falsifiablitiy reques considartion of alternative explanation ahead of time. and designing expriments so that results cannot be observed on the basis of alternate explanations
- An alternate explanation that could account of the experimental results is called a "confounding factor"
-  A principle job of scientists is thinking about what the confounding factors are


### thinking beyond experiments

Experiments are only of of the research strategies used for research.
We also have: 
- Desing and creation, Survey, Case study
For reasearch questions related to strategies, falsefiability does not make sense. Rather you need to have a clear picture of a research project that would fail to answer the research question. How could your app fial to fulfill hte need it was supposed to deliver? how could your best practices/requirements failt to be trustable and useful. Note that failed research is also productive.


### Evaluation measures
- Binary classification: why is accuracy not suitable
- Consider accuracy to be the percentage of the samples that were correctly classified

### Participants

People directly involved: interview suppliy documents, complete questionnare
Other reaserchers: read review and learn from your research
People affected by your research: users, impacted
and finally you


### Rights of participants
- Right not to participate
- Right to withdraw
- Right to give informed consent
- Right to anonymity
- Right to confidentiality


### Ethical decision making frameworks
- Utilitarian approach: the cost and harm to an individual is wieghed against the potential benefits to many.
- Deontological approach: an individual has rights, which cannot be overridden, no matter the benefit to the wider community

### Conceptual framework
- The different factors relevant for your formulation of your topic
- Your ways of thinking about your topic(via a thoery or some well-informed assumptions)
- Your research methodolgy: a combination of your strategies and your methods
- your approach to analyzing data your generate(quantitative or qualitative)
- If applicable: your approach to design and creation(systems development methodolgy)
- How you evaluate your reasearch

### Thoeretica framework
consists of concepts and, together with their definitions and reference to relevant scholarly literature. existing theory that is used for your particular study.
Must demonstrate and understanding of theories and concepts that are relevant to the topic of your research paper and that relate to the brader areas of knelwedge being considered


### topic vs research question

There is a traingle of of things work together
Research question     <- your specific research question
Conceptual framework  <- Your strategies and Data generation methods
Theoretical framework <- Previous work: Concepts and theories
general topic         <- What you are interested in


### Objective of literature review
- Aware of existing work in the chosed topic area
- Pace the reseracher's work in the context of what has already been published
- Point to strenghts, weaknesses, omissions or bais in the previous work
- Identify key issues or questions that are troubling the research community
- Point to gaps that have not yet been identified of addressed by researchers
- Suggest theories that might explain data the researcher has gathered from the field
- Identify theories that might explain data the researcher has gathered from the field
- Identify research methods or strategies that the researcher will use in the research
- Enable subsequent researchers to understand the field and the researcher's work withing that field

### sevent steps for a litarature review
1. Searching
2. obtaining
3. assessing
4. reading
5. critical evaluation
6. recording
7. writing

- use reference management software
- Which paper does this paper cite?
- Which papers cite this paper?

## Research strategies


### Survey
Obtain the same kind of data from a large group(sample) of people (or events) in a standardized and systematic way. Then look for patterns in that data that your can generalize the the general population

Remember survery is a strategy and can be combined with different data generation methods -> it is a way to analyze data

### Planning and designing survey's
- Data requirements: which data do you want to generate
- Data generation methods
- Sampling frame: a list or collection of the whole set (population) of people (or events) that could be included in your survey, form which you will choose a sample
- Sampling techniques
- Take response rate and smaple size into account
- Response rate influences the representativeness of the sample
- Raising reponse rate
	- Clear statement of purpose, time commitment etc, 
	- Identifying non-responding people and reminding them, realizing their reasons

### Sampling techniques
##### Probabilistic sampling
They have equal samples, population representative ,strong basis for generalization
- Random
- Systematic: starts, and samples at regualr intervals
- Stratified: Identifies sub-populations and ensures each are equally represented in the sample
- Cluster: Focuses on a representative group

##### Non-probabilistic sampling
Non-equal samples, less costly, weak basis for generalizaiton, may be adaquate for certain research
- Purposive: motivate the choice of each sample
- Snowball: uses one sample to gain access to other samples
- Self-selection: samples are chosen because they are easy to access

### Statistical inference
This is the making of estimates concerning a population from information gathered from samples.
Descriptive vs inferential statistics
Interval estimate vs rejecting hypothesis


### Interval estimate

Margin of error:
- Tells us how close the value measrued on the smaple is to the value of the true, underlying population
- How accurate your results are

Confidence level: 
- usually 95%
- If the sampling process was reapeted an infinite number of times, the proportion of those times that the value of the true underluing population would actually fall withing the margin of error for this sample

### Evaluating survey-based research
- advantages
	- Wide and inclusive coverage of samples
	- Producing a lot of data in a short time / low cost
	- Lending themselves to quantitative data analysis
	- Easy replication
 
- Disadvantages
	- Lack of depth Focus is on what can be counted
	- Provide time-dependent snapshot of subject
	- Don't show cause and effect 
	- Don't allow direct contact with respondents such as watching their body language


### Product (artefact) of deisng and creation
- constructs: concepts and vocabulary
- Models: representations
- Methods: guidance on the tyes of models to be produces or the process that can be implemented as a computer-based system
- Instantiations: A working system that demonstrates the product that can be implemented as as computer-based system
- Reseach should demonstrate not just technical skills, but also academic qualites: new knowledge analysis, explanation, argument, justification, critical evaluation

### Planning and conducting a design and creation research

- Awareness: recognize and express the problem
- Suggestion: creative leap to a possible idea/solution
- Development: implement the idea as an artefact
- Evaluation: assesment of value and of whether the artefact meets expectation
- Conclusion: identify the knowledge gained, formulate future work

### Two destinct methodologies

Research methodologies: the combination of strategies and data generation methods 

Systems development methodologies: the guidelines that you follow for analysis, design, implementation and testing

Traceability: readers should be able to trace back to the steps


### Evaluation

The criteria you use to evaluate depends on the reason you developed the artefact in the first place

Functional requirements: Requirements on certrain behaviours

Non-functional requirements: requirements that judge the operation of a system -> portability personalisations, performance, etc

### Design and creation proofs (evidence)
Some reaserch is evaluated in real-life context
Others provide a proof
- Proof of concept: A prototype that shows that the design has certain properties or habes in a perticular way that is evaluated in a restriced context
- Proof of demonstration: a prototype that is evaulated in a restricted context -> Restriction on user group/task
- A scientific hypothesis: takes account of what you know and what you don't know
- A well formulated scientific hypothesis is falsifiable -> there are steps you can take to determine that it's not true
- In order to decide it;s not true, you must compare it to an alternative
- When you formulate experiments, you must consider alternative explanations ahead of time



## Experiments
- A strategy that investigates cause and effect relationship
- Tries to prove/disprove that a cause and effect hypothesis is true
- Should include many instances as possed to case study
- Should include only a few study parameters as opposed to case study

### Characteristics
- Precise observations and measurements
- Pre-test and post-test observations
- proving or disproving a hypothesis
- Identifications of causeal factoers, ie. One-directional links
- Explanations, prediction, repitition

### Conducting the experiment
- Find the hypothesis to be tested
- find the dependent and independent variables
	- Dependent variable is altered by altering the indepedent variable
	- A (indepedent) causes B (Dependent)
- Find the control mechanisms: help you control all the contaminating variables
- Observe and measure
- Be careful about internal and external validity
- Document everything so it an be repeated


### Controlling

- Eliminate factor form experiment eg. via exclusion criteria
- hold the factor constant if it can't be eliminated
- Use large random selection
- Use control groups
- Blind experiments



### Validity threats
- Internal validity: show that results are attributeable only to changes in independent variable. Threats:
	- Differences between experimental and control group
	- History
	- maturation
	- Instrumentation
	- Experimental mortality
	- Reacticity and experimenter effects
 - External validity: Show that your results are generalizable. Threats
	 - Using only special types of participants
	 - Using samples that are not representative of the population
	 - Too few participants
	 - Non-repetetive test cases


### Types of experiments
- Pure lab experiment: high control over parameters, unrealistic settings.
- Quasi-experiments/field experiments:
	- Realistic setting
	- Free flow of contaminating factors, difficult to conclude
- Uncontrollable trial
	- Fake experiments
	- Need pre-test measures
	- Better to use case study instead


Advantages of Experiment
- Well-established method
- The only way to show cause effect relationships
- Don't have to cost ossociated with field work
Disadvantages:
- Create artificial situations that don't exist in the real world
- Often impossible to control for all the parameters
- Difficult to recruit representative samples
- Ramdomization and statistical validity result in high cost


### Case study
- Looks at a chosen case withing real-life context
- focuses on all the factors, issues, politics, processes and relationships in the case
- By exploring all of these factors together, the researcher is able to gain a picture of how the factors link
- Tries to explain how and why certrain outcomes might occur in a particular situation
- By studying a particular instance, insight is gained and knowledge is generated that might be relevant to other situations

#### Characteristics
- Depth rather then breadth
- Natural setting
- Multiple sources and data generation settings

#### Types of case study
- exploratory
	- Used initially in order to define a hypothese about a new research topic
	- When there is little literature available about he research topic
- Descriptive: describes without speculating about why things happened
- Explanatory: tries to explain why things happened
- Typical instance: can be generalized
- Extreme instance: it works here, it will work everywhere
- Test-bed for theory: school example is of instantiation of a theory
- Convenience: the simplest
- Unique opportunity

#### advantages
- good for complex problems with lots of parameters
- Good where there is low degree of control over parameters
- Helps us understand attitudes, cultures, meanings and other non-objective aspects of a situation
#### disadvantages
- it's not considered a hard-core method by the positivist camp
- Not easy, can take time, be confusing
- Difficult to get access to data



## Data generation

### Philosophical paradigms
- Fundamental worldviews that will effect research questions, data collections and analysis methods
- main paradigms, positivism, interpetivism, Critical research
- Ontology -> nature of being, Defines what the paradigm takes to be the nature of reality 
- Epistemology -> nature of knowledge. Defines how the paradigm acquires knowledge about the reality


### Positivsim
- Ontology -> the world is a fixed, external reality. It's ordered and regular, and not random
- Epistemology -> We can acquire knowledge about the world via the scientific method
- Research involves searching for universal alws and patterns, usually involving cause and effect
- The scientific method allows us to build theory: the best possible knowledge wa have at the moment


#### Shortcomings
- Reductionism: Not everything can be broken into parts
- Repition is not always possible
- Generalization is not always desireable: understading the specific situation can be useful
- Not everyone sees the world in the same way
- Laws and patterns are constructed by people: To apply the scientific method you need a hypothesis, but some somewhere constructed the hypothesis
- Falsifiability -> if somehtings is found false just once, it can never be considered true again

#### Techniques of the scientific method
- Reductionism: breaking things down into smaller and smaller parts and studying those aprts
- repeatability: repeat the experiments to determine that the results cannot be attributed to another cause
- Refutation: if an experiment cannot be repeated, the hypothesis behind the experiment is refuted

#### Cycle of the scientific method

- Formulate theory about some observed aspect of the world
- derive hypothesis
- Test hypothesis objectively
- Observe results
- Confirm or refute hypothesis
- Accept, modify or reject theory

### Interprative paradigm
- offers a way of understanding computing as a practice that is constructed and deloped by humans

#### characteristics
- Multiple subjective realities
- Dynamic, socially constructed meaning
- study of people in their natural social setting -> adopt the perspective of the participants
- Researcher reflexivity -> researchers are not neutral
- Qualitative data analysis -> words metaphors, images, stories
- Multiple interpratations -> researches offer more than 1 explanation
- Descriptions, explanations and interpretations must have plausibility and supported by evidence

| Positivism   |      interpretivism      | 
|----------|:-------------:|
| Validity | Trustworthiness | 
| Objectivity | confirmability | 
| Reliability |Dependability | 
| Internal validity |Credibility | 
| External validity |Transferability | 




### Critical research
- Concerned with identifying power relations and contradictions and empowering people to eleminate them
- In contract to interpretive research, which assumes that "natural settings" are "neutral", critical research assumes that natural settings are defined by the forces of economic political and cultural authoritiy


#### Characteristics
- Emancipation -> freeing people from power relations
- Critique of tradition -> assumptions are pointed out and confronted
- Non-performative intent -> Research should not be directed at improving control of management or making companies more efficient
- Critique of technical determinism -> Challenge the view that the march of technology is inevitable
- Reflexivity -> Research does not occur in a vaccuum

### Interviews
- Obtain detailed info
- Ask questions that are complex, open
- Explore emotions or experiences (requires trust)

#### Types of interviews
- Structured interviews -> checking/validating, qeustions are in fixed order
- Semi-structered intervies -> Discovering/exploring, Themes are fixed, questions and question order can vary
- Unstructured interviews -> Discovering/exploring, Only topic is fixed, themes and questions can vary



### Questionnaires
- obtain information from a large amount of people
- Obtain brief and uncontroversial information
- Obtain standerdized information
- When you have time to wait for the responses and time to process them
- Types -> self administered, Researcher administerd

#### rules
- do not write leading questions
- Avoid loaded questions
- Avoud double barreled questions
- Don't use absoluted

#### Validity and reliability
- Content validity -> well balanced, covers all aspects of the topic
- Constuct validity -> understand the idea's and scope behind the questions in the same way, unambiguous answers
- Reliability -> will respondents give the same answers every time?



### More tearms
#### observations
Obeserve what people do
Can be covert of overt

#### Systematic observations
- Decide in advance the particular events that you would like to observe
- Use a predefined schedule to note their occurrences
- Inter-observer reliability -> how well observers agree with each other

#### Participent observation
- the researcher is a participant in the situation that is under study
- The researcher experiences the situation from the point of the study

#### Types of participant observation
- Complete observer -> present but not active
- Complete participant -> present and part of the group
- Participant-observer -> Follows people present in the situation
- Practitioner-research -> researches own situation


### Documents
- found ducoments -> exist prior to research
- Researcher generated documents -> Put together solely for the purpose of research and would not have otherwise existed
- Primary sources -> Original document
- Secondary sources -> A document about the documents (survey)
- Documents as vessels -> documents are considered to hold data, what meaning is in the documents
- Documents as objects -> documents are considered to be entities. Who creates the document and how are they circulated

#### Analyzing ducoments and observations
- Goal -> create a set of concepts that provide an abstract, general representation of the informations in your documents of observations
- Content analysis -> detect the presence of ideas concepts and truth in hidden facts
- Card sort -> a game that allows a group of researchers to create a stable set of concepts on the basis of texts


## Data analysis

### Quantative data analysis
- data/evidence based on numbers
- quantitive data != qualitative data

#### types
- nominal data
	-> Data that describes categries ->> gender, nationality, study
	-> Responses can be expressed in numbers but no mathematical operations can be performed
- Ordinal 
	-> numbers allocated to a quantative scale
- Interval data
	-> like ordinal data but differences between points are consistenly the same
	-> Example ->> year of birth, temperature
	-> Addition and subtraction is possible on interval data
- Ratio data
	-> Like interval data, but there is a true zero on the measurement scale
	-> Example ->>  weight, length, reaction time
	-> Multiplication and division is possible on ratio data

#### Data coding
- predefined answer options should be coded
- predefined codebook should be mutually exclusive, exhaustive, and consistently applied


#### Data visualization
- bar charts
- tables
- pie charts
- Scatter plots
- Line graphs

 
#### Statistics
- Mean -> avarage
- Median -> the medpoint of the range of scores
- mode -> most common value in the dataset
- Range -> difference between the highest and lowest value in the dataset
- Fractiles -> Dividing the dataset in smaller parts
- Stadard deviation used the quantify the amount of varation in a dataset

- Correlation coeffecient -> the link between two varibles
	- a value between -1 and 1
	- 0 -> no correlation
	- > 0 -> positive correlation
	- < 0 negative correlation

- Test of significance -> quantify how easily pure chance can explain the results ->> independet T-test, depedant T-test, Chi-square etc
	- p-value what is the probability of the null hypothesis being true
	- $\alpha$  significance level -> predfined boundry beneath which a p-value indicates a signficance
		- p < 0.05 -> significant ->> reject the null hypothesis
		- p < 0.01 -> also significant but even more convincing
		- p >= 0.05 -> not significant ->> accept the null hypothesis
		  

- T-test -> test whether two quantative data sets (that correspond to two different categorical values) are significantly different based on the mean
- Chi-square test -> tests whether the relationship between two variables is significant

- Statistical significane is different from practical significance
	- Statisfican significance doesn't tell us the size of the effect
	- Statistical significance doesn't tell us whether we would notice the effect in practice


#### disadvantages from practical quantitative data analysis
- danger is using computers to perform the tests, without understanding those tests yourself
- it's not as scientifically objective as it appears, many decisions taken by the researcher
- The analysis can only be as good as the data initially generated

### Qualitative data analysis
Frequently used in the interprative research paradigm
the idea is to examine the meaning and symbolic content of qualitative data
Importance to remember that there's no right answer but rather an analysis supported by examples

#### types
Structured text -> news articles, books
Unstructered text -> transcription, interviews
Audio, recordings, music
